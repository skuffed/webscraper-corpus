double check preprocess 
  for punctuation and etc
  if character not ASCII, remove?


finsih program to create inverted index
  think about rewriting to same file
  think about separating our crawling and querying

Work on document and writing up about each step


END GOAL:
ask user for query and make a vector from it
  do tf idf calc and cosine similarity
  compare against docs
  display best results

build loop to loop through each query defined
    calculate the precision and recall for each query
      cut list to about 50 or so?
      dont use whole entire list of results
    average out at the end
    do for all 4 variations of preprocessing
      re index each time

true pos = got it and it is in the results
false negative - in the results, but we didn't find it in our search
false pos - got it, and it is not in the list
